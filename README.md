# 📧 Python Email Automation

A simple Python script to send styled HTML emails with an attached PDF via Gmail's SMTP server.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time weather from Open-Meteo API
- Secure email sending over SSL (`smtplib`, `ssl`)
- Rich HTML email layout with inline CSS
- PDF file attachment
- Prompted input for Gmail App Password

## 🔧 Usage

1. Replace the `sender_email` and `receiver_email` variables with your own.
2. Make sure the path to your PDF file (`lorem_Ipsum.pdf`) is correct.
3. Add your Gmail App Password.
4. Place your PDF at the correct path (My_Resume.pdf).
5. Run the script in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or locally with Python 3.

> ⚠️ You must use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for Gmail — not your regular password.
